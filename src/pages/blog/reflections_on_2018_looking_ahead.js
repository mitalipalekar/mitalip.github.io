            Ever since I started college, I‚Äôve been writing down my reflections and highlights on the past year as well as 
            where I see myself going next.  This year, for the first time, I‚Äôm planning on making them public.

            <b>So...why make it public now?</b>

          Well, over the last few months I‚Äôve taken a bunch of time off from school to intern.  While interning has 
          allowed me to learn alongside some of the smartest people I know, I also had much more free time than I‚Äôve 
          ever had before. This has got me thinking a lot about the power of technology and how today, I am able to 
          share me with everyone very easily. And, so with that, I am planning on chronicling my life and some of its 
          musings along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
          Here are some of my highlights, reflections and aspirations going forward:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Led the UW SWE Career Fair & Evening With Industry Banquet, our two largest events of the year, 
                as UW SWE President. Absolutely surreal to introduce the banquet - a pinnacle to my involvement with UW SWE.
              </li>
              <li>
                A ton of things on the SWE front: swept all the collegiate awards at WE Local for our section, won 
                the Emerging Leader Award and passed on the torch to the next group of SWE leaders, a bittersweet moment. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Presented my research at the UW Research Symposium.  Really cool to sum up months of effort into a 
                poster and present alongside many of my friends (and future researchers!)
              </li>
              <li>
                Attended my last husky football game as a husky.  Go dawgs!

            <ul>
              <li>
                Interned at Stripe.  Hard to sum up in words how amazing it was to get to know everyone in the 
                office and contribute in a meaningful way!
              </li>
              <li>
                Interned at LinkedIn.  Such a fun summer working alongside some amazingly talented people, 
                volunteering with women in tech events and working at a company that aligns with my core values.
              </li>
              <li>
                Interned at Facebook.  Learnt from some really talented people and engineers.  Learnt a few things 
                about how to improve my efficiency as an engineer.  And that hint water is bad.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the vein of interning, after 15 months and 5 different companies, finished my last day as 
                an software engineering intern. :(

                Met Emily Chang, author of Brotopia.  Such a cool lady who spoke fearlessly about things that 
                I‚Äôve thought a lot about.
              </li>
              <li>
                Got contact lenses.  A huge deal for me as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wanted to do for a while, 
                but never got around to.
              </li>
              <li>
                Celebrated my 21st bday with some of my favorite people in the world, both family and friends.  
                What‚Äôs 21 without a little bit of fun :)
              </li>
              <li>
                Completed my first hike in WA (after two whole years in WA, ha).  Can‚Äôt wait to hike more, 
                WA does have some great mountains!
              </li>
              <li>
                Attended the Female Founders Conference.  Great people and ideas as usual.

              <li>
                Travelled to DisneyLand, Las Vegas, NAPA, Vancouver and Hawaii - fun times with fun people!
              </li>
              <li>
                Started doing yoga, zumba and salsa on the regular.  Feels great to find healthy things to do that I enjoy.

            <b>A lil bit of Reflection</b>
          </div>
          <p>
            Overall, this year had a lot in store, both professionally and personally.
          </p>

          <p>
            On an academic and professional note, I am really glad that I took the time to intern at different 
            companies as it allowed me to prototype new experiences, engineering projects and company cultures 
            within the span of few short months.  This gave me key insights into what type of role and people 
            I want to surround myself with after graduation.  I also learnt a very important lesson along the way: 
            Slow down and take time to invest in things that you really want to.  Don‚Äôt be in a rush to graduate; 
            spending time ‚Äúfiguring things out‚Äù will position you much better long term, even if that means you 
            have to take an extra quarter or two. More on that in another blog post though.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the flip side, doing several internships forced me to cut down the amount of work that I could be 
            engaged in with school, especially related to research.  As I enter into my final two quarters of 
            undergrad, a personal goal I have for myself is spending a bit more time doing research as it‚Äôs 
            probably the last time that I will have the platform and resources to do so.  
          </p>

          <p>
            While academics and career growth are great, 2018 was the first year that I learnt the importance of 
            ‚Äúinvesting in yourself‚Äù.  I am so happy that I took the time to engage in activities that made me happy, 
            surround myself with people that I care about and take time off to rejuvenate.  I know that these small 
            investments have made a huge difference to my personal positivity and happiness and it‚Äôs something that 
            I highly recommend to others.  Take time to invest in yourself - later you will definitely thank present you.

            <b>Looking Forward to 2019</b>
          </div>
          <p>
            2019 is a special year as I get to finish my 16th year of schooling and start my official full time 
            job (no more breaking things I guess ü§∑üèΩ). Some of my personal goals for myself:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Get comfortable in my full time software engineering job. Immerse myself in my company‚Äôs community.
              </li>
              <li>
                Travel more. Take that extra leap of faith and travel to places I‚Äôve never been before.  Go back to India again.
              </li>
              <li>
                Publish my research at a conference.  More importantly, invest more time in doing research.  
                The journey and experience is more important than the end result.
              </li>
              <li>
                Write more.  Publish more of my writing online.
              </li>
              <li>
                Participate in more public speaking gigs.  
              </li>
              <li>
                Continue to build out my online brand.  I‚Äôve never been much of a twitter/linkedin etc nerd / geek, but maybe it‚Äôs time to become one?
              </li>
              <li>
                Continue doing zumba, yoga and salsa weekly.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
