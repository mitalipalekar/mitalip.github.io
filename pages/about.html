					<P>
						Hi, I’m Mitali!  
					</P>

					<p>
						I am a rising sophomore pursuing Computer Science with Interdisciplinary Honors at the University of Washington and am proud to call sunny Cupertino, CA my home.  Last summer, I interned at NASA Ames in their Human Systems Lab as a Software Development Intern working on procedure execution software for the International Space Station.
					</p>

					<p>
						Tracing my path to UW, I moved around quite a bit, spending almost eight years in India, the country of my ethnic origin.  Whilst living in India, I was exposed to a diverse demographic with a unique set of perspectives and issues as well as a very stringent educational set-up. This challenging environment instilled in me a sense of self-discipline and motivation to take advantage of the opportunities presented to me at UW.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						I took my first Computer Science course my freshman year of high school, opting for Computer Applications as an elective.  I distinctly remember the bewilderment and awe that I felt when within milliseconds of pressing the 'compile' button, the terminal window flashed with the message, "Hello World", converting my Java source code into an actual virtual manifestation.  Even though I might have been one of the few girls in my class, I began to love programming once I understood the logic behind the programming syntax.   Personally, I love Computer Science because it is one of the few fields which allows tangible gratification – one can conceive of an idea and actually see it come to fruition within a few months, an aspect that I find extremely rewarding and exciting.
					</p>

					<p>
						Coming to UW, my schema of Computer Science has accelerated from programming taught within the classroom to the realm of algorithms, software and hardware as they relate to CSE subfields such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Ubiquitous Computing. In the past year, UW has pushed me to explore the unknown and along the way discover my interests in CSE as well as issues that I am extremely passionate about.  I have realized my passion for education and information access, particularly for women and minority groups because I believe that diversity is invaluable in promoting a more balanced and inclusive thought process and perspective.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I am currently looking for part-time opportunities in winter/spring as well as full-time research/internship opportunities to further develop my technical abilities while also working on projects that create impactful products for my community.   Please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:mitali97@cs.washington.edu">mitali97@cs.washington.edu</a>!
